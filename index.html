            Formation
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the Devonian period (c. 350 mya), Michigan was located near the equator, with a warm, shallow sea covering the state. This environment was ideal for clams, corals, cephalopods, fish, and many other forms of shallow marine life. The Petoskey stone is a coral that has been fossilized by calcite or silica replacement. These ancient corals lived in colonies, with each six-sided chamber on the stone representing an individual coral polyp. The dark spot, or eye, in the center of each chamber is the mouth of the ancient corals, now filled with petrified silt.

           Location
       </h2>
       <p>
            The Petoskey stone can be found anywhere in the state of Michigan from the Traverse City area to Alpena. They can often be found in gravel pits and on road beds; however, the stone is most prevalent on and around Little Traverse Bay, in the town that gave the stone its name, Petoskey. Their presence there is due to glaciers that passed over the region in the Pleistocene epoch (c. 2 mya), plucking masses of fossilized coral from the Devonian bedrock and dropping them across the area. Wind and wave action have since rounded the coral masses into stones.

           Polishing
       </h2>
       <p>
        And now for the real fun! Petoskey stones are made up of calcite, which is soft enough to be easily worked, but dense enough to take a nice polish. This makes Petoskey stones a great candidate for hand polishing!
        <br />
        <br />
        WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO POLISH THE STONES:
        <br />
        <br />
        Petoskey stone <br />
        Sandpaper (220, 400, and 600 grit) <br />
        A thick towel or newspaper <br />
        A piece of corduroy or velvet <br />
        Polishing powder <br />
        Water <br />
        <br />
        Once you have found the stone you want to polish, sand it down with the 220 the sandpaper mentioned above. After rubbing, rinse and dry the stone. Examine the stone for scratch marks, and if there are any, keep on sanding! All scratch marks should be gone before moving onto the next step, sanding with 400 grit sandpaper. This step should remove any coarse spots on the stone. Once again, rinse, dry and check the stone. Then, sand the stone with the 600 grit paper to make sure that the stone is smooth and scratch free. When you think it looks perfect, continue sanding for another 10 minutes just to make sure. At this point, it is time to polish. Sprinkle the damp corduroy or velvet with polishing powder. A short, rotating motion will polish the stone. However, if scratches appear, start from the beginning with the 220 grit paper to remove them! When youâ€™re finished with the polishing, simply rinse the stone off in clean water and dry it. Then you'll have your own hand-polished Petoskey stone, just like the ones below!
